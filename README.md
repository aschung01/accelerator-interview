# Interview Simulator

Interview Simulator is a Y-Combinator/Neo Accelerator interview simulator which asks general
questions about you and your company, akin to the questions in which you
may be asked in a real Y-Combinator, or any incubator/investor, interview.

Interview Simulator is based on iPG, which was written by James Cunningham and Colin Hayhurst for their
Y-Combinator interview with [GoScale](https://goscale.com).
